## Prerequisites:
- NodeJS
- npm
- Angular CLI

## Story:
As a Developer I want to have an example App to showcase how a Resolver in Angular works.
It should prefetch data before navigating to a route and it should also display a loading spinner.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. Angular Setup
2. Angular Frontend and NestJS Backend should be started via one script, but can also be started separately
3. Angular resolver should be executed before hitting a route and fetch data from the backend via a service
4. While our resolver/service is fetching the data from the backend a loading spinner should be displayed
5.
